# How to: MR-EvE and literature data queries in EpiGraphDB 

This repository contains basic examples for querying MR-EvE and literature data in EpiGraphDB. This code is made available alongside the analysis published in the article _"Integrating Mendelian randomization and literature-mined evidence for breast cancer risk factors"_ on [MedRxiv (link to be added)]() 

The main development repo of this project is [https://github.com/mvab/epigraphdb-breast-cancer](https://github.com/mvab/epigraphdb-breast-cancer), and the examples presented here may be helpful for understanding some of the analyses presented there.
